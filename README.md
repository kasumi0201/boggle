# DYI Bootcamp
Say you needed to teach a bootcamp all of a sudden and needed some challenges? This repo may or may not provide said challenges, for a price. In order to receive challenges answer me the following questions three?

* If a HREF is a page without users, is it even a link?
* Is labor entitled to all of which it creates?
* How do you break the loop caused by two Canadians offering each other the door?

Now that's over with let's move on...

## Challenges
You may need to 'gem install rspec' before trying out the tests included with some of these challenges. It should be as simple as running 'rspec' to see if your solution works.
